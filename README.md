# foster
HackATL15 project

Our goal is to provide a platform where donors and NGO's (initially homeless shelters exclusively) can connect.  Everyday people neglect giving homeless people money because, not only is it awkward, it could be dangerous and the money may go to drugs or illegal substances.

Foster addresses these issues with our website platform.  Money from donors goes to the homeless shelters indirectly through Amazon credit.  The shelters may then identify items they need (food, clothes, etc) and will be purchased and delivered through Amazon.  We will track these transactions and route the data back to donors so that they may see their individual impacts.

Revenue will be generated through a small (~2%) transaction fee for every donation.  We will start marketing to attract homeless shelters to get on board with our program.  A strong network of shelters will then help us attract the donors.  We aim to be selective with our homeless shelter beneficiaries to ensure that the corruption does not happen.
